# jokempo

  Jokempô+ (or rock-paper-scissors) is a small project developed by me as a college assignment during February of 2022. The proposal of the assignment was to make a rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock game using only Batch.
  Had a lot of fun doing this, and even though it's just text, I think the UI came out pretty good.
